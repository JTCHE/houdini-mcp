    Use it to build a network: many nodes, their wires and their parameters go
    in one round trip and one undo group, and a person can undo the whole thing
    with one keystroke.

    Do not use it when a later step needs to read what an earlier step made.
    The list runs without you in the middle, so nothing can branch on a result.

    operations: a list. Each item is {"tool": "<tool name>", "params": {...}},
    with the same parameters that the tool takes on its own. Every tool in this
    server can go in the list, except batch itself.

    Every step is checked before any step runs: a step with a wrong argument
    stops the batch with its index and its error, and nothing changes.

    Returns JSON with one result for each operation, and the picture of every
    capture step. The list stops at the first failure, and the steps before it
    are undone, so a failed batch changes nothing: the report names the index
    that failed and the error. A step whose item failed is a failed step, and
    so is a parameter write that did not apply.

    A batch that works cooks the display node of each SOP network that it
    touched: `check` gives its point and primitive counts, and the touched
    nodes that have errors. Read it before you build on the result.

    A capture step with no `output` writes to a file of its own, so one batch
    can hold several captures.
