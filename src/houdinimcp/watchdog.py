"""Stop a call that runs past its time budget, or that the caller asks to stop.

A call runs on the main thread of Houdini, and while it runs Houdini answers
nothing: not the bridge, not the user. One careless script must not cost the
user the scene, so one thread watches the call that runs now and raises
`Stopped` inside it when its budget is spent, or when the bridge writes the
interrupt file of this port (session action='interrupt').

The exception arrives at the next Python step. A single long call into Houdini
(one cook, one iterPoints on a huge geometry) finishes first.
